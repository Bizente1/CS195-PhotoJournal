                        What I love about this picture is that it sums up most of our time in the Allen Scholars. Late night coding with our 
                        classmates all around us, panicking because the assignment is due the next day. The first week of class was all about cohort building and I'm glad
                        we all got to know each other in that short amount of time/ I was worried coming into the University of Washington I was gonna have a hard time making new friends
                        but as the week went on and we got to learn about each other inside and outside the classroom I realized that I had already made so many friends. 
                        This photo really solidifies that through the hardship we were enduring (Making a website) we all grew closer.

                    <p class="text section-text">
                        One of the main questions I had when I was getting ready to come to the University of Washington was how was I gonna get around?
                        Since all my family was from the east side of the state we hadn't had much experience with public transportation so I was fearful about using it.
                        After having the college navigation class I was now fully confident to take the fast path in life and use the better alternative to walking, public transportation.
                        In this photo specifically my friend Angel and I are taking the bus from the Husky Union Building back to our dorms in Lander Hall, saving ourself the energy and hassle
                        of walking. Now I take the public transportation almost everywhere I go and I have this class to thank especially now and in the future I get to explore the city much more effectively.

                       Another thing I struggled with before taking this CS195 class was making my online presence and searching for jobs.
                       This week we had focused on making our resume and LinkedIn accounts along with learning how to search for jobs both on and off campus.
                       In the photo show for this week I am connecting on LinkedIn with my fellow Allen Scholars, this is a gate way to show us how to be
                       connected and present on the online world. Now I feel much more confident with my ability to connect with others online and show the world who I am.
                       I also feel more confident when it comes to find job and internship opportunity then I was before,
                       this was always something I was really worried about before I entered UW but now because of this class I feel at ease.

                    <p class="text section-text">
                        Something always told to us as kids is that we need to hold strong to our values,
                        but as kids we don't know our own values and as we grow we get too busy to really sit down and ponder our values.
                        In week four of CS 195 we got a chance to sit down with a list of values and really narrow down what we believe in.
                        I believe in a lot of core values that the deck of cards we got had but as we went on in class we had to narrow down which is our top 5
                        and doing that I was able to find out what I truly believed. This lesson made me reflect on myself and I came out of it learning something new about myself.
                        Now I understand what values will bring me to my most satisfying lives and I intend to keep myself as true to those values as I can.
